        skos:definition  "Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a serious complication in mechanically ventilated children, increasing risk of mortality and morbidities including prolonged intubation and intensive care unit stays. Limited understanding of the microbial and host factors associated with VAP has precluded development of truly effective prevention and treatment strategies. We hypothesized that specific ecological patterns of the airway microbiome precede VAP and that the interaction of viral infection, bacterial populations, and the balance between host immune activation and immune suppression play crucial roles in determining whether a given patient develops VAP. We investigated this hypothesis with a prospective observational study with longitudinal (daily) examination of the airway microbiome in high risk mechanically ventilated children together with simultaneous proteomic assessments of the host immune response. Study participants were enrolled from 2015-2017 from participating sites in the NICHD Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network (CPCCRN), including UCD/Childrens Hospital Colorado (Aurora, CO), UCSF Benioff Childrens Hospital (San Francisco, CA), UCLA Mattel Childrens Hospital (Los Angeles, CA), Childrens Hospital of Michigan (Detroit), Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia (Philadelphia, PA), Nationwide Childrens Hospital (Columbus, OH), Childrens National Medical Center (Washington, DC), University of Pittsburgh Childrens Hospital (Pittsburgh, PA). 455 subjects were enrolled between the ages of 31 days and 18 years. Subjects were followed throughout the hospital admission of their incident mechanical ventilation episode. The overall objective of the CHEAR project is to evaluate the effect of tobacco smoke exposure (TSE) and other environmental pollutant exposures on the composition and diversity of the bacteria in the lower airways in critically-ill, mechanically ventilated pediatric patients as well as the outcomes of these children." .

        skos:definition  "Urban environments are a poorly understood toxic environment for children with asthma. In order to develop effective therapies and interventions, improved characterization of exposures and exposure-health outcome relationships is needed. The Denver Asthma Panel Study (DAPS), which began in 2014, is the parent study for this CHEAR project. The goal of DAPS was to investigate the relationships between asthma-relevant environmental exposures and asthma severity in an urban cohort of children, ages 8-16 years, with exacerbation-prone asthma. Personal and bedroom environmental exposures (particulate matter < 10 micrometers in diameter, ozone, and nitrogen dioxide) and asthma severity outcomes (lung function, exacerbations, inflammation, and control) were measured seasonally over the course of one year in the Denver metro area. A total of 68 participants were enrolled: 56 exacerbation-prone asthmatics and 12 control participants without allergies or asthma. Combined, the participants were 35 female, 69 Latino/Hispanic, 10 American Indian/Alaskan Native, 1 Asian, 19 Black/African American, 46 white, and 13 more than one race. The median age and annual household income was 11 years and $20,000 to $24,999, respectively. The goal of our proposed CHEAR study is to expand our investigation of how asthma-relevant exposures (tobacco smoke, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, phthalates, volatile organic compounds, and other exposure-related metabolites) impact asthma severity and biological responses (oxidative stress, cytokines, inflammatory markers, and other related metabolites)." .

The MADRES study began in 2015. Women and their infants are followed from early pregnancy through the first year of life. The objective of the approved CHEAR project is to investigate the impacts of prenatal metal mixture exposures on newborn methylation patterns and birth weight, an important risk factor for long-term health. The University of Michigan CHEAR Lab Hub will measure a panel of 21 metals in 1st and 3rd trimester urine samples and will additionally measure the cord blood CD4+ methylome, using whole genome bisulfite sequencing, in a smaller subset of participants (N = 30)." .

We leverage existing data on toxicant exposure during all three timeframes, including bisphenol A (BPA), metals and phthalates, and propose to measure polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) metabolites in archived urine samples from the mothers and children. Additionally, we will carry out genome-wide DNA methylation analysis in peripheral leukocytes at all three timeframes, and untargeted metabolomics analyses in fasting serum during late adolescence to gain insight into molecular pathways linking exposure to each of these toxicants singly and as mixtures to health outcomes during adolescence." .

Both aims will be conducted as cross-sectional analyses. Of the 630 children, 303 are female, 199 are non-Hispanic black, 167 are non-Hispanic white, 175 are Hispanic and 89 are Asian/Pacific Islander. Moreover, children participated at one of nine study clinics across the United States; hence, our population represents a geographically diverse cohort.

Based on these findings, we are currently examining a subset of CHS participants (N=200) that represent extremes of NRAP exposure occurring in Southern California in the Southern California Children Environmental Health Center (SC-CEHC) Project 1 (the parent project), which capitalizes on CHS resources and extensive pollutant measurements to investigate the impact of lifetime air pollution exposures on obesity, fat distribution, glucose homeostasis, lipid profile, systemic inflammation and the metabolic syndrome at age 17-18 years. These participants are being extensively phenotyped for obesity using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Glucose homeostasis is being assessed using an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The proposed CHEAR project will support an innovative collaboration between the CHS and the Emory CHEAR Laboratory Hub to perform non-targeted high resolution metabolomics (HRM) on 200 CHS fasting serum samples. The ultimate goal of this CHEAR project is to investigate the hypothesis that environmental chemicals, regional air pollutant (i.e. PM2.5) and traffic-related air pollution exposures (CALINE model-predicted NOx) can alter key metabolic pathway(s) and that these alterations are associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes-related traits during the important developmental period of adolescence." .

Phenols, phthalates, organophosphorus flame retardants (OPFRs), and trace elements will be analyzed in maternal urine collected between 8 and 14 weeks of gestation. Aim 2: Identify metabolite profiles from untargeted analyses that are associated with first trimester exposures. Aim 3: Identify genes in umbilical cord blood leukocyte DNA that are differentially methylated, hydroxymethylated, and/or expressed by first trimester exposures. Aim 4: Evaluate metabolites and differentially regulated genes as mediators of relationships between first trimester exposures and birth outcomes." .

        skos:definition   "The primary hypotheses is that zinc deficiency or exposure to heavy metals can influence short and long term neurocognitive outcomes in healthy community children and in children with severe malaria, and that children with cerebral malaria have specific metabolomic changes that relate to longterm neurocognitive impairment.The original study is a longitudinal cohort study of Ugandan children on the relationship between cerebral malaria (CM) and severe malarial anemia (SMA) on mortality (in hospital and during follow up) ( 2 yrs) and longterm neurodevelopment and behavior ( >5yrs). The CHEAR study will examine the effects of micronutrient deficiency, metal exposure, and inflammation or mortality and longterm neurodevelopment  ( >5 yrs) and behavior in children with severe malaria (CM or SMA) and in community children (CC). There are measured levels of zinc, and heavy metals (lead, mercury, copper, manganese etc.) in children with severe malaria and community controls. " .

        skos:definition   "The MARBLES (Markers of Autism Risk in Babies: Learning Early Signs) prospective study of over 450 high-risk pregnancies recruits mothers who have a child with confirmed ASD and are either planning a pregnancy or are pregnant with another child, in order to understand what influences the outcome of the younger sibling and to identify early markers of ASD. These younger siblings are at 13-fold higher risk for developing ASD (1:5), than children in the general population (1:68).MARBLES recruits Northern California families from lists of children receiving services through the California Department of Developmental Services, typically within two hours driving distance to the University of California Davis MIND Institute in Sacramento where clinical assessments are administered. The resulting study populations are racially, ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse. Children are followed until the child is three years old, at which time they receive a diagnosis of typically developing, autism, or other developmental concerns. Medical, nutritional, lifestyle, and contaminant exposure data, developmental assessments, and biologic specimens are collected periodically throughout pregnancy and the first years of the child. For this CHEAR study, metabolomic markers in child umbilical cord and maternal pregnancy EDTA plasma will be measured and compared across diagnostic outcomes to allow a comprehensive screen of compounds and/or pathways potentially associated with ASD." .
